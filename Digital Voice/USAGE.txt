Digital Voice - 20130219
========================

The package currently consists of six programs, DCS Client, DExtra Client,
SoundCardClient, DVAPClient, DVRPTRClient, DVToolReader, and GMSKClient. These all
allow different combinations of hardware, along with a DV-Dongle to access either
the DCS or DExtra reflector system, or on-air D-Star systems.


DCSClient
------------

The purpose of this program is to access reflectors and repeaters connected to 
the DCS system. a sound card for headphones/microphone (I use a USB headset 
from Logitech), and access to a DV-Dongle.

Firstly you will need to set your preferences. Go into Edit->Preferences and
choose each tab in turn, many will need to be entered before you can begin.
Note that after changing a number of these entries, you will need to restart the
program for the changes to take effect.

You will need to set the Callsign, this change takes effect immediately. The 
Sound Card are the devices that will be used for your microphone and speakers to 
actually speak to other people.

The DV-Dongle must be connected to a USB port. To use a DV-Dongle, simply set 
the Device to the COM port on which the Dongle is connected, if set to "<none>" 
then no DV-Dongle is assumed and the program will not operate. On Linux systems 
the DV-Dongle will usually appear on one of the /dev/ttyUSBX devices.

The Message is up to twenty characters that will be placed into the Slow Data
field and will be displayed on the radio of the other station. This setting
takes effect immediately.

The Bleep setting controls whether an end bleep occurs at the end of receiving a 
D-Star transmission. The default is on, and it mimics the sound of the bleep 
made by Icom D-Star radios, however it can also be annoying so it can be 
switched off. This setting takes effect immediately.

Optionally a startup reflector and module may be set. Setting the reflector to 
None disables this, if set, then the client will attempt to link to the selected 
reflector and module a few seconds after the software starts up.

The Controller sets hardware device used to control an optional transceiver to 
create a Hot Point. This may set to None when no radio is connected or if the 
radio uses VOX, or a serial port, a URI USB, or a Velleman K8055. The Audio 
Delay can be set to ensure that the received audio matches the squelch input. 
The PTT inversion setting is for interfacing to radios that have the opposite 
sense, the same goes for the Squelch inversion setting which does the same for 
the squelch input.

Function                              Velleman  URI USB   Serial Port
Radio Squelch                         Input 1   8         DSR or CTS
Transmitter PTT                       Output 1  1         DTR and RTS

On the File menu is an option to Record data. The recording option ensures that 
all received DCS "transmissions" are recorded to .dvtool files for playing 
back later with DVToolReader (see below). Recording does not stop the decoding 
of the DCS signals in real-time.

The main section of the screen is involved with connecting to thr remote DCS 
reflector repeater, and currently the list of ones available is held in the 
DCS_Hosts.txt file. The required system is selected in the list box and the 
Connect button is pressed, hopefully after a short while a message will appear 
saying "Connected to DCS001 H" or similar. The module choice is from A to Z.

Note that it will probably necessary to open up your router and/or firewall to 
enable the program to run reliably. DCS uses UDP port 30051 and this may need 
to be set up as a virtual server or however its termed within your router.

Below these settings are the Transmit button which as the name suggests, puts 
the program onto transmit, and sets the PTT if it is set. At the same time, an
indicator appears on the screen to show that you are on transmit.

When a valid signal is being received, a Busy signal will be displayed, which
could be very useful if some form of Squelch is being used.

Below these settings is the Current section. This is where information about the
current and previously heard DCS stations is show. The top section contains
more information.

Finally there is a list box showing a history of all the stations heard since
the program was started. It shows a cut-down version of the information above
it.

When running, the program logs some information into the DCSClient.log file 
in the users home directory.

The list of available reflectors and gateways is controlled by the 
DCS_Hosts.txt file which can either found in either the home directory of the 
current user, or in another location. This location is "/usr/local/etc" on 
Linux and the programs running directory, probably "C:\Program Files\Digital 
Voice" under Windows. The file in the home directory takes precedence. The 
installed example file lists the publicly known reflectors, the format is 
described within the example file.


DExtraClient
------------

The purpose of this program is to access reflectors and repeaters connected to 
the DExtra system. a sound card for headphones/microphone (I use a USB headset 
from Logitech), and access to a DV-Dongle.

Firstly you will need to set your preferences. Go into Edit->Preferences and
choose each tab in turn, many will need to be entered before you can begin.

of the DExtra signals in real-time.

The main section of the screen is involved with connecting to thr remote DExtra

DExtra_Hosts.txt file. The required system is selected in the list box and the 
Connect button is pressed, hopefully after a short while a message will appear 
saying "Connected to XRF001" or similar. The module choice is one of A, B, or C 
and these can be changed without having to disconnect and connect again.

Note that it will probably necessary to open up your router and/or firewall to 
enable the program to run reliably. DExtra uses UDP port 30001 and this may need 
to be set up as a virtual server or however its termed within your router.

Voice" under Windows. The file in the home directory takes precedence. The 
installed example file lists the publicly known reflectors, the format is 
described within the example file.


DVToolReader
------------

This program takes .dvtool files as created by either SoundCardClient, DExtraClient, 
GMSKClient, DVAPClient, DVRPTRClient, or DVTOOL and plays them. It is a
relatively simple program, which essentially allows for the replay or previously
logged transmissions. Before it can be used, the program needs to be configured,
to do this go into Edit->Preferences and fill in values the Sound Card, which is
where the decoded audio will be played,  and for the location of the DV-Dongle.

The DV-Dongle must be connected to a USB port. To use a DV-Dongle, simply set 
the Device to the COM port on which the Dongle is connected, if set to "<none>" 
then no DV-Dongle is assumed and the program will not operate. On Linux systems 
the DV-Dongle will usually appear on one of the /dev/ttyUSBX devices.

The Bleep setting controls whether an end bleep occurs at the end of receiving a 
D-Star transmission. The default is on, and it mimics the sound of the bleep 
made by Icom D-Star radios, however it can also be annoying so it can be 
switched off.

When making changes to the Sound Card or DV Dongle, you must restart the program
before your changes take effect.

Much of the information on the screen is the same as that show by SoundCardClient
(see above) and for more information, see the entry for that program.

When running, the program logs some information into the DVToolReader.log file
in the users home directory.


The Rest of the Software
------------------------

The other programs in the software, SoundCardClient, DVAPClient, DVRPTRClient, and
GMSKClient, are all similar in their operation. Each allows a PC with a DV-Dongle
and a microphone/speaker and a suitable modem to access D-Star over the radio.
All of the programs (bar the DVAPClient) require the modem to be connected to a
9600Bd capable radio in order to operate.

Because all of these programs are so similar, the common parts are covered here
before sections detailing the differences between the programs.

Firstly you will need to set your preferences. Go into Edit->Preferences and
choose each tab in turn, many will need to be entered before you can begin.
Note that after changing a number of these entries, you will need to restart the
program for the changes to take effect.

You will need to set the Callsign, only the first field needs to be entered,
this change takes effect immediately. The Sound Card is the device that
will be used for your microphone and speakers to actually speak to other people.

The DV-Dongle must be connected to a USB port. To use a DV-Dongle, simply set 
the Device to the COM port on which the Dongle is connected, if set to "<none>" 
then no DV-Dongle is assumed and the program will not operate. On Linux systems 
the DV-Dongle will usually appear on one of the /dev/ttyUSBX devices.

The Message is up to twenty characters that will be placed into the Slow Data
field and will be displayed on the radio of the other station. This setting
takes effect immediately.

The Bleep setting controls whether an end bleep occurs at the end of receiving a 
D-Star transmission. The default is on, and it mimics the sound of the bleep 
made by Icom D-Star radios, however it can also be annoying so it can be 
switched off. This setting takes effect immediately.

On the File menu ia an option for Recording. The recording option ensures that 
all received D-Star transmissions are recorded to .dvtool files for playing back
later with DVToolReader (see below). Recording does not stop the decoding of
D-Star signals in real-time.

On the main screen can be seen some boxes that may have data entered into them.
Your is the remote stations callsign, or more commonly just "CQCQCQ" which is 
the default setting. RPT1 and RPT2 are used to access your local D-Star repeater 
and the values will need to be found seperately, for simplex work these should 
be set to "<unused>", the default setting. Values previously used are stored for 
easy access, these will appear in the drop down list once that callsign has been 
used for transmission at least once.

Below these settings are the Transmit button which as the name suggests, puts 
the program onto transmit, and sets the PTT if it is set. At the same time, an
indicator appears on the screen to show that you are on transmit.

The One-Touch Reply is usually used when responding to a station coming through 
a repeater. It takes the received header values of the transmitting station and 
places them into local callsign boxes to make replying to the station easier. 
Subsequent transmissions from the client will have the correct values to 
guarantee that the remote station will receive your transmission.

When a valid signal is being received, a Busy signal will be displayed, which
could be very useful if some form of Squelch is being used.

Below these settings is the heard section. This is where information about the
current and previously heard D-Star stations is show. The top section contains
more information, for example the Flags section which contains information about
the D-Star header flags in hexadecimal.

Finally there is a list box showing a history of all the stations heard since
the program was started. It shows a cut-down version of the information above
it, but should still be useful for all that.


DVAPClient
----------

The purpose of this program is to emulate a D-Star capable radio. To this end it
requires a DVAP, a sound card for headphones/microphone, and access to a DV-Dongle.
With these items, you should be ready to go.

The DVAP sets the DVAP modem and radio combination. The available settings are:

Band: This is which type of DVAP you have, the 2m or 70cms version.
Port: This will be a COM port under Windows or a /dev/ttyUSBx port under Linux.
Frequency: This is the transmit and receive frequency in Hertz.
Power: The output power in dBm with the maximum being 10 dBm (10 mW).
Squelch: The receive level at which the squelch will trigger.

When running, the program logs some information into the DVAPClient.log file in
the users home directory.


DVRPTRClient
------------

The purpose of this program is to emulate a D-Star capable radio. To this end it
requires access to a 9600Bd capable radio, connected to a DV-RPTR Modem, a sound 
card for headphones/microphone, and access to a DV-Dongle. With these items, you
should be ready to go.

The Modem sets the DV-RPTR Modem. There are many settings here, although only
four may need changing to get operational. Firstly the version needs to be set
correctly, Version 1 is the old formware with versions similar to 1.10e while
Version 2 refers to the new xdvrptr firmware that first became available in
September 2012. Secondly the port needs to be set, on Windows the modem will
appear as a standard COM port, but on Linux it will appear under the device
name of /dev/ACMx where x is a number.

The RX and TX Inversion allow for inversion within the radio is occuring on
receive and transmit respectively. With the version 2 driver, automatic detection
of the need for RX Inversion is built-in and so this entry is unavailable. With
the version 1 driver if you are unable to receive any stations then changing the
RX Inversion may be what is needed, conversely if you are unable to talk to any
stations, try changine the TX Inversion setting.

The Channel setting does not need to be changed, and only applies to the version 1
driver anyway. The Mod Level alters the amplitude of the audio generated by the
modem and will directly affect the transmitted deviation of the signal. The TX
Delay is only alterable with the version 1 driver and may need adjusting to match
your transmitter.

When running, the program logs some information into the DVRPTRClient.log file in
the users home directory.


GMSKClient
----------

The purpose of this program is to emulate a D-Star capable radio. To this end it
requires access to a 9600Bd capable radio, connected to a GMSK Modem, a sound 
card for headphones/microphone, and access to a DV-Dongle. With these items, you
should be ready to go.

The Modem sets the GMSK Modem. There is one setting under Linux, the hardware
address. Under Windows there is the choice of the driver type as well as the
address, the types available are WinUSB and LibUsb. Although WinUSB is preferred
under Windows, LibUsb is included to support the original Satoshi drivers. The
default address is 0x300 for both types of driver, and will probably not need
changing most of the time.

When running, the program logs some information into the GMSKClient.log file in
the users home directory.


SoundCardClient
---------------

The purpose of this program is to emulate a D-Star capable radio. To this end it
requires access to a 9600Bd capable radio, connected to a sound card, a second
sound card for headphones/microphone (I use a USB headset from Logitech), access
to a DV-Dongle, and optionally a serial port for PTT control. With these items, 
you should be ready to go.

The Radio Sound Card is the sound card that will be connected to your radio to
allow the GMSK signals to be passed in and out of the program. This will go to
your 9600Bd modem port on your radio, otherwise you'll need a soldering iron!

GMSK Inversion is for cases when the polarity of the GMSK is inverted by your
radio. Leave these as unchecked initially, and only set them if you have
problems, check with a local D-Star user to see where the problem lies. These
settings take effect immediately.

The Controller sets hardware device used to control the transmitter. This may 
set to None for testing, or when the radio has VOX, or a serial port, a URI USB, 
or a Velleman K8055. A PTT Delay can be set here to ensure that the transmitter 
operates at exactly the same time that the D-Star audio is present. If a delay 
is set then the PTT is delayed with respect to the audio. The PTT inversion 
setting is for interfacing to radios that have the opposite sense. There is also 
a transmit input for manual control of the transmitter, in addition to the 
button on the screen.

The assignments of the different pins are:

Function                              Velleman  URI USB   Serial Port
Manual Transmit                       Input 1   8         DSR or CTS
Transmitter PTT                       Output 1  1         DTR and RTS

On the File menu are the options to Open and for Recording. The Open option is
used for playing previously recorded files of GMSK data which are used instead
of the sound card for the duration of the file. These files must be mono WAV
files with a sample rate of 48kHz. The recording option ensures that all
received D-Star transmissions are recorded to .dvtool files for playing back
later with DVToolReader (see below). Recording does not stop the decoding of
D-Star signals in real-time.

When running, the program logs some information into the SoundCardClient.log file in
the users home directory.
